# Cancer-Detection-CNN
I'm building an AI-powered system to detect pancreatic cancer from medical images. Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the system analyzes images and predicts whether they are cancerous or healthy. The project includes a web app where users can upload medical scans, and the AI model provides instant predictions.
